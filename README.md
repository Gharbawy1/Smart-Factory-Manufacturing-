# Smart Factory Manufacturing
This C++ project showcases a unique data structure combining linked lists, stacks, and queues to simulate product flow in a smart factory. It demonstrates object-oriented design principles, efficient data management, and potential real-world applications.


**Versatile Data Structure:
**Linked list with stack-based nodes for space efficiency.
Sub-linked lists acting as queues for element management.

**Object-Oriented Design:
**Class hierarchy for stacks, queues, and the main linked list.
Inheritance and polymorphism for extensibility.

**Efficient Operations:
**Optimized methods for push and pop operations.
Data integrity maintained throughout operations.

**Real-World Application:
**Simulates product sequencing in a smart factory.
Manages product flow and manufacturing operations.

**Bonus Features:
**Dynamic resizing of the linked list (if implemented).
Robust error handling for stack and queue scenarios (if implemented).
